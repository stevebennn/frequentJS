# frequentJS
library of frequently used js methods on native javascript objects.

If you're like me...you're constantly googling, sometimes what feel are like "basic" string, array and object methods. Being a long time excel user. I find myself saying...why isn't this simpler!? Could it be? Ka-pow! **frequentJS**....



#String Methods

###`.left()` 
returns the specified number of characters starting from the left. 

example: `let string = first name;` `console.log(string.left(5));`

output: `first`


###`.right()` 
returns the specified number of characters starting from the right. 

example: `let string = first name;` `console.log(string.right(4));`

output: `name`
