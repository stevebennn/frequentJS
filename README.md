# frequentJS
library of frequently used js methods on native javascript objects.

If you're like me...you're constantly googling, sometimes what feel are like "basic" string, array and object methods. Being a long time excel user. I find myself saying...why isn't this simpler!? Could it be? Ka-pow! frequentJS....
